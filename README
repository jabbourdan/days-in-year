project:

The task is to write and test a function which takes
three arguments (a year, a month, and a day of the
month) and returns the corresponding day of the year, or
returns None if any of the arguments is invalid.

examples :

    Input: (2000, 12, 31) - (Y, M, D)
    Result:366
    Input: (2000, 1, 1) - (Y, M, D)
    Result:1
    Input: (1900, 3, 1) - (Y, M, D)
    Result:60
    Input: (2000, 3, 1) - (Y, M, D)
    Result:61

NOTE : month february (2) has different days in specific years

examples : 

    Input: 1900,2 - (Y, M)
    Result: 28
    Input: 2000,2
    Result: 29
    Input: 2016,1
    Result: 31
    Input: 1987,11
    Result: 30

As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years
may be leap or common. The former are 366 days long, while
the latter are 365 days long.
Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582),
the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:

    • if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a
    common year;
    • otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100,
    it's a leap year;
    • otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400,
    it's a common year;
    • Otherwise, it's a leap year.


examples :
    Sample input: 2000
    Expected output: Leap year
    Sample input: 2015
    Expected output: Common year
    Sample input: 1999
    Expected output: Common year
    Sample input: 1996
    Expected output: Leap year
